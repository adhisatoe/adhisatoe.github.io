Hi there, <br>
let's enjoy a short story

basically in this personal blog I'll write anything about my chaotic life in **MEGA** Jakarta.

I grew up in a small town in Bogor, which is well known as a rain-city, the suburb of ***Jakarta Raya***, where we as Bogorians peoples quite notorious for sending uninterupted waterflow from Puncak during a rainy season.

A lot has changes in this area since the early 80's where I used to grow up here.

Anyway,
like any normal newbie in starting something,
I'll try to improve this blog site pieces-by-pieces.

Collecting memories from my past, assemble it, and try my best to visually rewritten it.

Nevertheless thanks for dropping by to my sites, which I'll try to update it often.

Cheers,

Adhi Dazz
