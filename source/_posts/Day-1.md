Day +1 on my way to recovery.

Lately I've been very drained as a person, as a professional, and as a humble pilgrim.

I had what known as **_"DESOLATION"_**,
in this troubled time, i found almost no meaning toward life and its future.

Over this past week, i've been practicing **_Spiritual Exercise_** *(based on St. Ignatius from Loyola)* as an escape to my situation.

So far, my emotions are like swinging in between bad and good mood.

And what trouble me is lack of guidance from the _spiritual guru_ for what I experienced.

Despite of this I'll try to continue doing this exercise.
It's not an easy path, but something inside of me gave a movement that this is the right way to be taken.

Peace out,

Adhi
